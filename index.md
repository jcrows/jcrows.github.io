# OUR STORY

A few weeks after we were married in March 2018, we packed up our lives and headed overseas. We believed that God had led us to ‘Travel by Faith’ for our first year of marriage. This ended up including six months in Thailand serving with OMF as homeschool teachers. It was during this time that God laid a burden on our hearts for the people of Thailand and started directing us to return long term. Since returning to NZ we have continued to journey with OMF as Jason completed his Bachelor of Theology and we welcomed Faith and Tikvah (Tivvy) into our family.

# TRAVELLING BY FAITH

Once we arrive in Thailand there will be much for us to learn. We will spend our first year at OMF’s Daniel Training Centre in Lopburi, studying the language and culture whilst fellowshipping with a local Thai church. During this time, we will also work together with OMF to discern our best placement in ministry. This will involve visiting various missionaries around the country and experiencing different ministries. During the next few years, we expect to work in supportive roles alongside more experienced missionaries.
Parenthood is also a journey of faith. Faith and Tivvy will have much to learn (as all kids do) with the additional challenge of growing up in a culture that is different to that of their passport country. We are grateful that OMF has a strong focus on caring for the wellbeing of missionary children, with many resources available to assist their members in this unique task. We were
both raised in homeschooling families, so we feel well equipped for the challenge of homeschooling and raising ‘Third Culture Kids.’

# FACING A TASK UNFINISHED

When we were in Thailand we learnt about the great need there, since Buddhism is closely linked with national identity. It is a nation of 70 million people with less than one percent being Christian. Many of Thailand’s believers are located in the north, meaning that many districts across the rest of the country have no church at all, and there is no opportunity for people to hear the gospel. OMF is working hard to plant churches in unreached districts, bringing the life and hope of Christ to those who may not otherwise hear.
